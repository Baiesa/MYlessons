price_of_apple = 2
price_of_milk = 4 
price_of_cherry = 7
total_cost = price_of_apple + price_of_milk + price_of_cherry
print(total_cost)



# Bank Interest

particular initial amount and a fixed yearly interest rate, 
calculate the total amount in your account after a year.
'''
initial_amount = 100000
interst_rate = 0.3
after_a_year = 105000
total_amount = (initial_amount * interst_rate, after_a_year) 
print(total_amount)
